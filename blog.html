    <h1>1. What is the difference between local storage and session storage?</h1>
    <h3><span>Local Storage: </span>Web storage, sometimes known as DOM storage, provides web apps with methods and protocols for storing client-side data. Web storage supports persistent data storage, similar to cookies but with a greatly enhanced capacity and no information sent in the HTTP request header.</h3>
    <h3><span>Session Storage:</span>Session storage is a popular choice when it comes to storing data on a browser. It enables developers to save and retrieve different values. Unlike local storage, session storage only keeps data for a particular session. The data is cleared once the user closes the browser window.</h3>

    <h1>2. What is the difference between Global Scope and Block Scope?</h1>
    <h3><span>Global Scope:</span> Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope. Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.</h3>
    <h3><span>Block scoped:</span> A block scoped variable means that the variable defined within a block will not be accessible from outside the block. A block can reside inside a function, and a block scoped variable will not be available outside the block even if the block is inside a function</h3>

    <h1>3. Javascript event loop how does it work</h1>
    <h3><span>Event Loop:</span>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</h3>

    <h1>How is javascript undefined?</h1>
    <h3><span>Ans: </span>A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined . A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned .</h3>
